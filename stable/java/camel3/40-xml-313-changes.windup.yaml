  message: This component has been refactored to be similar to other Camel components.
    The old component had an unusual static configuration of the MllpComponent which
    now is refactored to be Camel standard with regular getter/setters. The component
    is now also configured reflection free. We also cleaned up how the component dealt
    with which charset to use when processing HL7 messages. Users using camel-mllp
    is recommended to test their applications when upgrading to ensure this continues
    to work.
