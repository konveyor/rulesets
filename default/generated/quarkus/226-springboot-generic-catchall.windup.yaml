  message: "If the application declares explicitly or uses any of the feature provided
    by the Spring `{{group}}:{{artifact}}` component,\n then check if there is a Quarkus
    Extensions with Spring API compatibility for the Spring `{{artifact}}` component.
    \n If yes, then replace the `{{group}}:{{artifact}}` dependency with the Quarkus
    extension. \n If no, consider rewrite the code that relies on this dependency
    leveraging the Quarkus Guides linked below. \n \n Otherwise, if the application
    hasn't got this explicit Spring `{{group}}:{{artifact}}` component dependency,
    it has been added transitively by another Spring component. \n Once the dependant
    Spring component will be removed, this issue will be fixed as well."
