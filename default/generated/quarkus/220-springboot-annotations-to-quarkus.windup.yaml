  message: "Remove the SpringBoot @SpringBootApplication annotation.\n\n A Spring
    Boot application contains a \"main\" class with the @SpringBootApplication annotation.
    A Quarkus application does not have such a class. Two different alternatives can
    be followed - either\n to remove the \"main\" class associated with the annotation,
    or add the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure` dependency as
    an `optional` Maven dependency. An optional dependency \n is available when an
    application compiles but is not packaged with the application at runtime. Doing
    this would allow the application to compile without modification, but you\n would
    also need to maintain a Spring version along with the Quarkus application."
