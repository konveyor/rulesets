    Methods in `java.lang.Thread` have been removed
    The `java.lang.Thread.stop(Throwable)` method has been removed, as it is dangerous for a thread to not only be able to directly stop another thread, but with an exception it may not expect. Instead, the thread should be notified to stop using a shared variable or `interrupt()`.. The `java.lang.Thread.destroy()` method was never even implemented and just throws `NoSuchMethodError`.
