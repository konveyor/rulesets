  description: Spring Framework 6.0 does not use Introspector anymore
  message: |
    The core container now performs basic bean property determination without `java.beans.Introspector` by default.

    In case of sophisticated JavaBeans usage, for full backwards compatibility with 5.3.x, specify the following content
    in a `META-INF/spring.factories` file, which enables 5.3-style full `java.beans.Introspector` usage:
    
    ```
    org.springframework.beans.BeanInfoFactory=org.springframework.beans.ExtendedBeanInfoFactory
    ```

  message: |
    Methods annotated with @Async must return either Future or void. This has long been documented but is now also
    actively checked and enforced, with an exception thrown for any other return type.
    
    If your @Async annotated method does not return `Future` or `void`, please change its signature.
