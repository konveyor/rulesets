  description: Spring 6 must use at least Hibernate 5.6.x
  message: |
    Due to the Jakarta EE migration, Spring 6 must use at least Hibernate 5.6.x. To make Hibernate 5.6.x compatible with
    Jakarta, make sure to also switch your hibernate dependency to the `hibernate-core-jakarta` artifact:
    ```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.hibernate.orm</groupId>
        <artifactId>hibernate-core-jakarta</artifactId>
        <version>5.6.15.Final</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
    Alternatively, consider migrating to Hibernate ORM 6.1 right away (exclusively based on `jakarta.persistence`,
    compatible with EE 9 as well as EE 10) which is the Hibernate version that Spring Boot 3.0 comes with.
