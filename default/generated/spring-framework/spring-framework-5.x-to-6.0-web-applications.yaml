  description: Trailing slack matching has changed in Spring 6.0
  message: |
    As of Spring Framework 6.0, the trailing slash matching configuration option has been deprecated and its default
    value set to false. This means that previously, the following controller would match both
    "GET /some/greeting" and "GET /some/greeting/":
  
    ```java
    @RestController
    public class MyController {
        @GetMapping("/some/greeting")
            public String greeting() {
            return "Hello";
        }
    }
    ```
  
    As of this Spring Framework change, "GET /some/greeting/" doesn't match anymore by default and will result in an
    HTTP 404 error. Developers should instead configure explicit redirects/rewrites through a proxy, a Servlet/web
    filter, or even declare the additional route explicitly on the controller handler
    (like @GetMapping("/some/greeting", "/some/greeting/") for more targeted cases.
    Until your application fully adapts to this change, you can change the default with the following
    global Spring MVC configuration:
    
    ```java
    @Configuration
    public class WebConfiguration implements WebMvcConfigurer {
        @Override
        public void configurePathMatch(PathMatchConfigurer configurer) {
            configurer.setUseTrailingSlashMatch(true);
        }
    }
    ```
