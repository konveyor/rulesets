    Java native libraries (JNI, JNA)
    Java native libraries might not run in a cloud or container environment.. Recommendations. * Review the purpose of the native library in your application.. * Check whether the native library is compatible with a cloud environment.. * Reuse or embed the native library or application in a cloud environment, for example, in a JBoss module.. * Replace, remove, or rewrite the native library or application using a cloud-compatible equivalent.
