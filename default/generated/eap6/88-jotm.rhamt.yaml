  message: "The modules required by JOTM's JTA implementation are not loaded by default
    on EAP6+.\n This likely results in a \"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: sun/rmi/server/UnicastServerRef\"
    exception when it is deployed.\n\n To solve this issue it is highly recommended
    to use JTA provided by JBoss EAP since JOTM is not maintained anymore. \n \n If
    you want to stick with JOTM, you can add \"sun/rmi/server\" as system export in
    your applications deployment-structure.xml as described in [this knowledge base
    article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1217863)."
