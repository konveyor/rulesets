  message: |-
    Java RMI is a tightly coupled service. Tight coupling is not suitable in a cloud environment because of scalability problems.

     Recommendations

     Use Java EE standard or loosely coupled protocols for backing service interactions:

     ** Message-based communication (JMS) for asynchronous use cases
     ** HTTP-based protocol or API (JAX-RS and JAX-WS) for synchronous use cases

     When used with load-balancing, both options ensure scalability and high availability.
