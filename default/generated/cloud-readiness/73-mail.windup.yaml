  message: |-
    The configuration parameters of SMTP services for outbound mail may contain environment-specific values such as static IP addresses, host names, properties, credentials, or certificates.

     Recommendations

     * In a cloud environment, mail systems should be considered backing services and treated like attached resources.
     * Ensure that the configuration of the underlying outbound mail connection is not environment-specific.
     * In OpenShift Container Platform, store configuration parameters as environment variables or in a ConfigMap.
