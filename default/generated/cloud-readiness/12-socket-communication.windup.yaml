    Socket communication
    Java sockets are internal endpoints of two-way communications. They are defined by an IP address, port, and protocol (TCP/UDP).. Socket communication is not suitable for a cloud environment because it requires fixed communication with a target host.. Recommendation: Use Java EE standard or loosely coupled protocols such as JMS, JAX-RS, or JAX-WS for backing service interactions.

    Java NIO channel
    Java NIO channels provide bulk data transfer to and from NIO buffers. They can be synchronously and asynchronously read and written.. Channels are not suitable for a cloud environment because they are not a reliable or scalable way to interact with other systems.. Recommendation: Use Java EE standard or loosely coupled protocols such as JMS, JAX-RS, or JAX-WS for backing service interactions.
