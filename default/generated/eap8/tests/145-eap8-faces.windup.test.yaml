      messageMatches: As of Jakarta EE 10, Jakarta Faces does no longer support JSP
        as a faces view technology. JSP usage within Jakarta Faces must be removed/substituted.
        Facelets will remain as the only default view language, and views can also
        now be created solely using java.
