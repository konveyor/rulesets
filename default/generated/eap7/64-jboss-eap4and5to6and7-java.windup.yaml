    Replace org.jboss.mx.util.MBeanProxyExt class
    In JBoss EAP 4 and 5 a lot of the mbean-related components were JBoss specific.. In JBoss EAP 6+ these mbean-related components (i.e., `org.jboss.mx.*`) have been removed in an effort to make the container more Java EE 6 specification compliant.. One will need to find an equivalent replacement: for class `MBeanProxyExt.create()` one can use `JMX.newMBeanProxy()`.

    Replace ServiceMBean and ServiceMBeanSupport
    JMX / MBeans is still fully supported as it is in the JDK specification.. If your MBeans were extending the old JBoss EAP MBean support classes such as `org.jboss.system.ServiceMBean` and `org.jboss.system.ServiceMBeanSupport`, these do not exist in JBoss EAP 6+.. These classes were hooked into the kernel in previous versions of JBoss EAP where everything was basically turned into an MBean.
