    Hibernate: Deprecated 'string' CLOB data type
    In versions of Hibernate prior to 3.5, text type was mapped to JDBC CLOB. A new Hibernate type, `materialized_clob`, was added in Hibernate 4 to map Java `String` properties to JDBC CLOB

    Hibernate: Removed package org.hibernate.connection
    From Hibernate 4.0 there were moved classes from package `org.hibernate.connection` to package `org.hibernate.service.jdbc.connections.internal`.. You should change your Hibernate setup to replace references to the old package names.
