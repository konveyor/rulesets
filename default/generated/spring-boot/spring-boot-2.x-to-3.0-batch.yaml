  description: "@EnableBatchProcessing not needed anymore"
  message: |
    Previously, `@EnableBatchProcessing` could be used to enable Spring Boot’s auto-configuration of Spring Batch. It is
    no longer required and should be removed from applications that want to use Boot’s auto-configuration. A bean that
    is annotated with `@EnableBatchProcessing` or that extends Batch’s `DefaultBatchConfiguration` can now be defined to
    tell the auto-configuration to back off, allowing the application to take complete control of how Batch is configured.

  description: Running multiple batch jobs is no longer supported
  message: |
    Running multiple batch jobs is no longer supported. If the auto-configuration detects a single job is, it will be
    executed on startup. If multiple jobs are found in the context, a job name to execute on startup must be supplied
    by the user using the `spring.batch.job.name` property.

  description: Store type explicit config no longer supported
  message: |
    Explicitly configuring the store type for Spring session via `spring.session.store-type` is no longer supported.
    In case multiple session store repository implementations are detected on the classpath, a fixed order is used to
    determine which SessionRepository should be auto-configured. If Spring Boot’s defined ordering doesn’t meet your
    needs, you can define your own `SessionRepository` bean and cause the auto-configuration to back off.
