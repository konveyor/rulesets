  description: Image banner support removed

    Support for image-based application banners has been removed. `banner.gif`, `banner.jpg`,
    and `banner.png` files are now ignored and should be replaced with a text-based `banner.txt` file.

  description: "@ConstructorBinding no longer needed at type level"
  message: |
    `@ConstructorBinding` is no longer needed at the type level on `@ConfigurationProperties` classes and should be removed.
    When a class or record has multiple constructors, it may still be used on a constructor to indicate which one should be used for property binding.
    
    If you were relying on autowiring of a dependency into the constructor of a `@ConfigurationProperties` class,
    you must now annotate it with @Autowired to prevent it being identified as a target for property binding.
