  description: 'server.max-http-header-size has been deprecated'
  message: |
    Previously, the `server.max-http-header-size` was treated inconsistently across the four supported embedded web
    servers. When using Jetty, Netty, or Undertow it would configure the max HTTP request header size.
    When using Tomcat it would configure the max HTTP request and response header sizes.

    To address this inconsistency, `server.max-http-header-size` has been deprecated and a replacement,
    `server.max-http-request-header-size`, has been introduced. Both properties now only apply to the request header
    size, irrespective of the underlying web server.

    To limit the max header size of an HTTP response on Tomcat or Jetty (the only two servers that support such
    a setting), use a `WebServerFactoryCustomizer`.

  message: |
    The phases used by the `SmartLifecycle` implementations for graceful shutdown have been updated. Graceful shutdown
    now begins in phase `SmartLifecycle.DEFAULT_PHASE` - 2048 and the web server is stopped in phase
    `SmartLifecycle.DEFAULT_PHASE` - 1024. Any `SmartLifecycle` implementations that were participating
    in graceful shutdown should be updated accordingly.
