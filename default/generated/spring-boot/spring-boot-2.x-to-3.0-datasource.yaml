    FlywayConfigurationCustomizer beans are now called to customize the FluentConfiguration after any Callback and
    JavaMigration beans have been added to the configuration. An application that defines Callback and JavaMigration
    beans and adds callbacks and Java migrations using a customizer may have to be updated to ensure that the intended
    callbacks and Java migrations are used.

  message: |
    Auto-configuration and dependency management for Flapdoodle embedded MongoDB has been removed. If you are using
    embedded MongoDB for testing, use the auto-configuration library provided by the Flapdoodle project or modify
    the tests to use the Testcontainers project instead of embedded MongoDB.
