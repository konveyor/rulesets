    FlywayConfigurationCustomizer beans are now called to customize the FluentConfiguration after any Callback and
    JavaMigration beans have been added to the configuration. An application that defines Callback and JavaMigration
    beans and adds callbacks and Java migrations using a customizer may have to be updated to ensure that the intended
    callbacks and Java migrations are used.

    If your application is affected, consider overriding the Liquibase version to meet your application’s needs.

    Auto-configuration and dependency management for Flapdoodle embedded MongoDB has been removed. If you are using
    embedded MongoDB for testing, use the auto-configuration library provided by the Flapdoodle project or modify
    the tests to use the Testcontainers project instead of embedded MongoDB.

  description: R2DBC bom no longer available
  message: |
    Spring Boot 3.0 uses R2DBC 1.0 by default. With the 1.0 release, R2DBC no longer publishes a bill of materials (bom) which has affected Spring Boot’s dependency management. The r2dbc-bom.version can no longer be used to override R2DBC’s version. In its place, several new properties for the individual and separately versioned modules are now available:
  
    - `oracle-r2dbc.version` (`com.oracle.database.r2dbc:oracle-r2dbc)`
    - `r2dbc-h2.version` (`io.r2dc:r2dbc-h2)`
    - `r2dbc-pool.version` (`io.r2dc:r2dbc-pool)`
    - `r2dbc-postgres.version` (`io.r2dc:r2dbc-postgres)`
    - `r2dbc-proxy.version` (`io.r2dc:r2dbc-proxy)`
    - `r2dbc-spi.version` (`io.r2dc:r2dbc-spi)`

  description: Elasticsearch high level REST client no longer supported
  message: |
    Support for Elasticsearch’s high-level REST client has been removed. In its place, auto-configuration
    for Elasticsearch’s new Java client has been introduced. Similarly, support for the Spring Data Elasticsearch
    templates that built on top of the high-level REST client has been removed. In its place, auto-configuration
    for the new templates that build upon the new Java client has been introduced. See the Elasticsearch section
    of the reference documentation for further details.
